# Data Seperator
DataSeperator is a tool designed to process and separate data from various input formats and store the results in different output formats. This can be particularly useful for data cleaning, analysis, and transformation tasks.

## Files
seperator.py: The main Python script that handles the data separation and processing.
database.db: An example output file generated by the script.
output.xlsx: An example output file generated by the script.
captions.txt: A sample text file containing captions for testing.

## Usage
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Run the seperator.py script using the command:
```
python seperator.py
```
The script will read from the database.db and captions.txt files, process the data, and output the results to output.xlsx.

## Example
To see the tool in action, run the seperator.py script. The output.xlsx file will be generated with the processed data from the input files.
